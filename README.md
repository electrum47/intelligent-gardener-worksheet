# Intelligent Gardener Worksheet

This is a spreadsheet based off the book _The Intelligent Gardener_ by Steve
Solomon. You'll want to read the book before attempting to use this spreadsheet.
However, dialing in which ingredients to use with paper can be tedious, so
having it in a spreadsheet form where you can quickly tweak the numbers to try
to balance everything out makes the process somewhat easier.

The spreadsheet is in OpenOffice/LibreOffice Calc format. OpenOffice and
LibreOffice are free downloads.
